## How to use

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it.
Download the latest stable version for Windows.
During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" (this is very important!).

Save the [script](https://github.com/txcceuu/fortnite-stretch-resolution/blob/main/main.py)

Double click script to open or go to download folder, type CMD, and copy and paste "python main.py"

## Important

In rare cases, if you encounter PermissionError, you might need to run it as admin

It's highly recommended to have Fortnite completely closed when you run this script to avoid any conflicts or issues with the game overwriting your changes.

While this script is designed to be safe, it's always a good practice to back up your GameUserSettings.ini file before making manual changes. You can find it at: ```%LOCALAPPDATA%\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\GameUserSettings.ini```

Future Fortnite updates might change the format or location of this file, which could potentially break the script. If the script stops working after an update, I will update it.
## To Do

- Change from Python to C++
- Make script/app more user friendly
- Have preset resolutions and aspect ratios
- Create option to change window style (Windowed, Windowed fullscreen, Fullscreen)
